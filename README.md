# NewsBear
Android app created for the Technovation Girls Challenge.

### **App Description:** 
In the age of the Internet and social media, teenagers are especially susceptible to fall for fake and uncredited news. Whether the article is posted to convince the reader of a certain biased siding, or to shock them into sharing for publicity, propagated manipulation through these posts can negatively and unjustly affect a young personâ€™s opinion and mental health. NewsBear is an easy-to-use Android app for teenagers that helps them find and share fact checked news articles.

### **App Features:** 
Keyword search for fact checked articles, organized layout of results (article title, review, date, and description), speech-to-text search, suggested keywords search, sharing with other communication platforms, button that leads to full article, and language and number of articles per search settings. Additionally, the first time the user opens the app, an welcome and introduction will show.
