#### **App Description:** 
In the age of the Internet and social media, teenagers are especially susceptible to fall for fake and uncredited news. Whether the article is posted to convince the reader of a certain biased siding, or to shock them into sharing for publicity, propagated manipulation through these posts can negatively and unjustly affect a young personâ€™s opinion and mental health. NewsBear is an easy-to-use Android app for teenagers that helps them find and share fact checked news articles.
